These subsets serve different purposes and are crucial for developing and assessing the performance of machine learning models. Let's explain the importance of each term:\n",

        "Training Set:\n",

During training, the model learns patterns and relationships in the data, and it adjusts its parameters or weights to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual labels or target values in this subset.\n",
        "Importance: The training set is crucial for building a model that can make accurate predictions. It's where the model learns the underlying patterns in the data and generalizes from the examples it has seen.\n",

Hyperparameters are settings that are not learned from the data but affect the model's behavior (e.g., learning rate or the number of hidden layers in a neural network). By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set, you can make adjustments to these hyperparameters to improve the model's generalization.\n",
        "Importance: The validation set helps you avoid overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. It helps you select the best configuration of hyperparameters for your model.\n",

        "Purpose: The test set is a dataset that the model has never seen during training or validation.
