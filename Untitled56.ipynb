        "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical format, but they are suitable for different types of categorical variables and have distinct purposes. Here's the key difference between the two, along with an example of when you might choose one over the other:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Nature of Categorical Variable: Ordinal encoding is used for categorical variables that have a natural order or hierarchy among their categories. In ordinal data, the categories have a meaningful sequence or ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encoding Method: Ordinal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category based on its ordinal position or rank. Categories are mapped to integers in ascending or descending order, with lower integers typically representing lower ranks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Label Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Nature of Categorical Variable: Label encoding is used for nominal categorical variables where there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories. Nominal data categories are essentially names or labels with no ordinal relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encoding Method: Label encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category without regard to their order or ranking. The assignment is often arbitrary and does not imply any specific relationship between the categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a dataset containing information about the education level of individuals:\n",
        "\n",
        "Categorical Variable: Education Level\n",
        "Categories: \"High School,\" \"Associate's Degree,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" \"Ph.D.\"\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If you believe that education levels have a clear, meaningful order or hierarchy (i.e., \"High School\" < \"Associate's Degree\" < \"Bachelor's Degree\" < \"Master's Degree\" < \"Ph.D.\"), you would use ordinal encoding. Assign integer values to these categories based on their rank or level, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"High School\" -> 1\n",
        "\"Associate's Degree\" -> 2\n",
        "\"Bachelor's Degree\" -> 3\n",
        "\"Master's Degree\" -> 4\n",
        "\"Ph.D.\" -> 5\n",
        "If you believe that education levels are merely nominal categories with no inherent order, you would use label encoding. In this case, you would assign arbitrary integer values to each category without considering their rank or level, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"High School\" -> 1\n",
        "\"Associate's Degree\" -> 2\n",
        "\"Bachelor's Degree\" -> 3\n",
        "\"Master's Degree\" -> 4\n",
        "\"Ph.D.\" -> 5\n",

        "The categorical variable has a clear and meaningful ordinal relationship among its categories.\n",

        "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable in a machine learning project. This method assigns ordinal values to categories in a way that reflects their influence on the target variable's outcome. It's particularly useful when dealing with categorical variables with an inherent order or when you believe the ordinal relationship with the target variable is meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculate the Mean (or another appropriate statistic) of the Target Variable for Each Category: For each unique category within the categorical variable, calculate a statistical measure of the target variable's behavior. Typically, this measure is the mean, but you can also use other measures like median, mode, or some custom aggregation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's illustrate Target Guided Ordinal Encoding with an example:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Suppose you are working on a machine learning project to predict loan default, and one of your categorical variables is \"Education Level.\" You believe that education level might have an ordinal relationship with loan default risk, where higher education levels are associated with lower default rates.\n",

        "Bachelor's Degree: 3\n",
        "Associate's Degree: 4\n",
        "High School: 5\n",
        "Now, you have encoded the \"Education Level\" variable into ordinal values based on its relationship with the target variable (loan default rate).\n",

        "When to Use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use this technique when you believe there is a meaningful ordinal relationship between the categories of a categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
        "It is particularly useful for categorical variables where the default order or labels don't inherently reflect the ordinal relationship.\n",

        "Binary Encoding: Create a single binary column, where Male is represented as 0 and Female as 1.\n",
